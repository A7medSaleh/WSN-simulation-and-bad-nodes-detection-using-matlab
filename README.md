In this code I build and simulate a wireless sensor network (WSN) also I generate a training model to train SVM machine learning model, then this model is tested on data very similar to real sensing data to evaluate the ability of this model to detect the bad nodes and calculate both training and testing error.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.

This software can be used in various fields like research in field of building a wireless sensor network and invistegating the use of machine learning in detecting bad (attacked) nodes in WSN.
